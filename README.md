## Introduction

Ostrich Solutions is a platform that helps regulated entities share data securely and build industry-level risk models using AI/ML and Big Data solutions. Our focus is on providing a Governance Solution that ensures personal data is protected through advanced security measures such as zero-knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation.

## Research

With the increasing prevalence of digital financial data sharing, driven by both regulatory and competitive forces, financial institutions can leverage this trend to gain economic value and better serve their customers. At Ostrich Solutions, we enable financial institutions to:

- Lower borrowing costs for consumers by enabling more accurate credit risk evaluation and risk-based pricing.
- Optimize their workforce, improve product delivery and customer service, and enhance fraud protection through easier data analytics.
- Gain valuable insights from their data that can inform business decisions and improve outcomes.

Our unique value proposition lies in attracting and nurturing data scientists from around the world to solve predictive analytics problems for our registered entities. By making datasets accessible, usable, and secure, our platform empowers financial institutions to harness the power of their data and make more informed decisions.

To achieve this, we build a robust platform that can handle large datasets and implement advanced data analytics techniques, such as machine learning algorithms and predictive modelling. Additionally, we ensure that the platform is secure and that data privacy and security measures are in place to protect sensitive financial data.
